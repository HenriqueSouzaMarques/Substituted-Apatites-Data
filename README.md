# Scientific Research Data Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that visualizes data obtained from scientific research. The provided Jupyter Notebook utilizes the `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `PIL` libraries to visualize various aspects of the research data.

## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Python and pip installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, you can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You'll also need Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

`pip install jupyter notebook`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.

### Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the command `jupyter notebook`.
2. A new browser window should open with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
3. Locate and open the `data_explorer.ipynb` notebook from the list of files.

### Running the Cells

The notebook contains several cells that you need to run in order. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Cell 1**: This cell installs the required dependencies. Run the cell by clicking on it and then clicking the "Run" button in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

2. **Cell 2**: This cell imports the necessary libraries. Run the cell similarly to Cell 1.

3. **Cell 3**: This cell reads the data from the 'data.pickle' file. Run the cell similarly to the previous cells.

4. **Cell 4**: This cell defines a visualization function. Run the cell similarly to the previous cells.

5. **Cell 5**: This cell demonstrates how to use the function to retrieve and visualize LDOS images from the 'data.pickle' file. Modify the function arguments as needed and then run the cell.
